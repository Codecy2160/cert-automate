# Cert Automate

## Description
This program is designed to automate the name input segment of certificate generation in an active Photoshop environment. It simplifies the process of generating certificates by reading names from a text file and automatically inserting them into a predefined certificate template. The program saves each generated certificate as a PNG file.

## Prerequisites
- Adobe Photoshop installed on your system.
- A text file containing the names to be used for certificate generation. The names should be separated by commas.

## Usage
1. Open Adobe Photoshop and open the certificate template file.
2. Ensure that the text layer for the name is selected in the template.
3. Run the provided script in the Photoshop ExtendScript environment.
4. When prompted, select the text file containing the names.
5. The program will process the names and insert them into the template, generating individual certificates for each name.
6. The generated certificates will be saved as PNG files in the same location as the template PSD file.

## Note
- Make sure to provide the text file containing the names with the correct format and delimiters (comma-separated).
- Customize the certificate template according to your requirements before running the script.
- This program assumes that the active document in Photoshop is the certificate template.
